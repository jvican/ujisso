# UJISSO in Scala
Suppose you feel inspired and excited about taking a new adventure. You come accross a cool language called Scala, you get proficient in it and you want to use everywhere,
including your internship project. Well, ok, that was my case. But it can be yours too. So here you have a module I have developed to allow authentication against the UJI SSO.
  
This project has been ported from Java (servlets api) and php code, the only two existing alternatives until now. They were developed by the UJI itself.
However, this library is totally __async__, built up on top of [Spray](http://www.spray.io) and [Akka](http://www.akka.io). It has a lot of documentation
because the existing alternatives were not very clear in the protocol specification. Now, you can built your own library
in your favorite language without any excuses. Just code.
